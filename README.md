The Café Digital System (CDS) is a menu-driven project designed to assist the café staff and administration in managing their operations efficiently. The system provides digital tools to streamline stock management, order processing, and employee coordination while restricting access through a secure login system. Developed using C++, this project incorporates key concepts such as file handling, sorting algorithms, and dynamic stock management.

The system is designed for:

Café Administrators: To manage stock, track orders, handle complaints, and maintain user credentials.
Café Employees: To process student/staff orders, manage transactions, and interact with the digital system.
Students and Staff: To search items, place orders, submit complaints, and view notifications through the digital system.
Key Features:
Secure Login System: Admins and employees have unique credentials stored in a file for access control. Admins can manage and update user credentials.
Stock Management: The system tracks item attributes such as name, quantity, and price, with options to add, remove, and update items.
Threshold Notification: Items falling below a predefined quantity threshold are flagged, and the system prompts for stock replenishment.
Search and Sort: Items can be searched and sorted based on name, price, or quantity using bubble sort.
Sales Tracking and Reporting: Daily sales are tracked based on stock depletion, with reports showing bestselling items and employee performance.
Complaint and Notification Handling: The system allows students to submit complaints, view café-related notifications, and check for ongoing promotions or offers.


This project is built with C++ and leverages file handling to store data for stocks, credentials, and notifications, ensuring persistence across sessions. It provides a modernized solution for the café's growing needs and enhances the efficiency of its operations.
